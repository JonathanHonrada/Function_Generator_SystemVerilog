#### Creators: Jonathan Honrada and Rocio Sanchez

## Summary
The purpose of this project is to implement a function generator by adding multiple sine and cosine waves digitally using the Fourier series, creating 4 different preset wave-types like sine, triangle, square and sawtooth waves. This digital periodic wave is then converted from a digital signal to an analog signal using a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) driver and RC low pass filter. Users can pass input parameters (scaling individual harmonics of sines and cosines up to the 8th harmonic) through the OTTER MCU to create custom waveforms. Below you can see the Fourier Series equation used to get the coefficients and frequency using scaled sine and cosine waves.

## Equipment Required
- Basys 3 Board
- Low Pass RC Filter (fC ~ 40 Hz)
- 1 0.1uF Capacitor
- 5 10kâ„¦ Resistors
- Jumper Wires
- Oscilloscope
- Breadboard 

## Circuit Architecture
In this project, we will be using the modules from the OTTER MCU in addition with the external hardware of the function generator coded in SystemVerilog to control the signal generation. **NOTE:** The verilog files for the OTTER MCU have not been provided.
